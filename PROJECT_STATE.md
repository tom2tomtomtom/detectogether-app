## ðŸ“Š Time Estimate
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 hours (Pet & Gamification)

- **Phase 4**: 8-14 hours (Backend & Deployment)
- **Total**: 20-30 hours to production

## ðŸš€ Quick Win Order (If Limited Time)
1. Pet polish (sleeping/idle + art)
2. Notifications refinements (engagement)
3. Achievements deepening (retention)
4. Backend Sync (critical for launch)
5. Trends/charts

## ðŸ’¡ Development Tips
- Test on real devices early
- Use Expo Go for rapid testing
- Keep animations under 60fps
- Batch state updates for performance
- Use React.memo for heavy components

## Known Issues
- Pet visuals are emoji placeholders; richer art desired
- Notification Settings temporarily exposed as a tab (to move under Account stack)
- Camera functionality not implemented - PHASE 3
- No backend connection - PHASE 4
- Trends/visualizations pending - PHASE 3
