## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 2: Pet & Gamification (Current Focus)

### Step 1: Pet Animation System (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Smart scheduling based on user patterns
- [ ] Notification preferences screen

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 3: Advanced Features

### Step 5: Camera Integration (2 hours)
**Tool**: Cursor
**Command**: "Add camera for skin/food photos"
- [ ] Install expo-camera
- [ ] Create CameraScreen component
- [ ] Add photo capture to:
  - Dermal Map (skin photos)
  - Gut Intelligence (meal photos)
- [ ] Store photos locally
- [ ] Photo gallery in each module
- [ ] Basic ML-ready structure (for future)

### Step 6: Social Features Prep (2 hours)

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 4: Backend & Deployment

### Step 8: Backend API (4-6 hours)
**Tool**: Augment (if needed) or stay in Cursor
**Options**:
1. **Supabase** (Recommended - easiest)
   - Auth, database, real-time sync
   - 500MB free tier perfect for MVP
2. **Firebase**
   - Similar features, Google ecosystem
3. **Custom Node.js + PostgreSQL**
   - More control, more work

**Features**:
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Data sync across devices
- [ ] Social features backend
- [ ] Push notification management
- [ ] Photo storage

### Step 9: Testing & Polish (2-3 hours)

### Step 10: Deployment (2-3 hours)
**Tool**: Expo + EAS Build
- [ ] App Store assets (screenshots, description)
- [ ] Privacy policy & terms
- [ ] TestFlight beta testing
- [ ] Play Store internal testing
- [ ] Production deployment

## ðŸ“Š Time Estimate
- **Phase 2**: 7-9 hours (Pet & Gamification)
- **Phase 3**: 6-8 hours (Advanced Features)
- **Phase 4**: 8-14 hours (Backend & Deployment)
- **Total**: 21-31 hours to production

## ðŸš€ Quick Win Order (If Limited Time)
1. Pet Animations (biggest impact)
2. Push Notifications (engagement)
3. Achievements (retention)
4. Backend Sync (critical for launch)
5. Everything else

## ðŸ’¡ Development Tips
- Test on real devices early
- Use Expo Go for rapid testing
- Keep animations under 60fps
- Batch state updates for performance
- Use React.memo for heavy components

## Known Issues
- Pet graphics are placeholder (simple circles) - NEXT PRIORITY
- No onboarding flow yet - PHASE 2
- Push notifications not configured - PHASE 2
- Camera functionality not implemented - PHASE 3
- No backend connection - PHASE 4
- Need achievement system - PHASE 2
- Missing data visualizations - PHASE 3
