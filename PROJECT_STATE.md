   - Color assessment with modal
   - Hydration tracking buttons
   - Daily stats display
   - Tips & Tricks section
5. **Pet System**: Basic pet representation in vista (needs graphics upgrade)
6. **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage integration ready

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining health modules (Vitality, Gut, Mind's Radar, Dermal Map)
2. Implement onboarding flow with pet selection
3. Add push notification system
4. Implement camera functionality for photo analysis
5. Create more sophisticated pet animations
6. Build out the gamification features (badges, challenges, social)
7. Add backend API for data sync
8. Implement proper UI/UX polish

## Known Issues
