3. Achievements deepening (retention)
4. Backend Sync (critical for launch)
5. Trends/charts

## ðŸ’¡ Development Tips
- Test on real devices early
- Use Expo Go for rapid testing
- Keep animations under 60fps
- Batch state updates for performance
- Use React.memo for heavy components

## Known Issues
- Pet visuals are emoji placeholders; richer art desired
- Camera functionality not implemented - PHASE 3
- No backend connection - PHASE 4
- Trends/visualizations pending - PHASE 3
