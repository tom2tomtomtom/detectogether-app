# üöÄ How to Start Developing DetecTogether

## Step 1: Running the App

The development server is now running! You have several options:

### Option A: Run on Your Phone (Easiest)
1. Install the **Expo Go** app from App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
2. Open Terminal and look for the QR code that appears
3. Scan the QR code with:
   - iOS: Camera app
   - Android: Expo Go app
4. The app will load on your phone!

### Option B: Run on iOS Simulator (Mac only)
1. Make sure Xcode is installed
2. In the terminal where expo is running, press `i`
3. The iOS simulator will open with your app

### Option C: Run on Android Emulator
1. Install Android Studio
2. Create a virtual device in AVD Manager
3. Start the emulator
4. Press `a` in the terminal

### Option D: Run in Web Browser
1. In the terminal, press `w`
2. Your default browser will open with the app

## Step 2: Making Your First Change

Let's make a simple change to see hot reloading in action:

1. Open the project in VS Code:
```bash
code /Users/thomasdowuona-hyde/detectogether-app
```

2. Navigate to `src/screens/HomeScreen.js`

3. Find this line (around line 25):
```javascript
<Text style={styles.welcomeText}>
  Welcome back{user.name ? `, ${user.name}` : ''}!
</Text>
```

4. Change it to:
```javascript
<Text style={styles.welcomeText}>
  Hello! Welcome to DetecTogether{user.name ? `, ${user.name}` : ''}! üéâ
</Text>
```

5. Save the file - the app will automatically reload with your change!

## Step 3: Understanding the Code Structure

### Key Files to Know:

1. **App.js** - The main entry point
2. **src/navigation/MainTabNavigator.js** - Controls the bottom tabs
3. **src/screens/** - Each screen of the app
4. **src/components/Vista.js** - The animated header
5. **src/store/useStore.js** - All app state management

### Making Common Changes:

**To change colors:**
- Look in the StyleSheet sections at the bottom of each screen file
- Primary blue: `#3B82F6`
- Success green: `#10B981`

**To add a new feature to a screen:**
1. Open the screen file (e.g., `FluidFlowScreen.js`)
2. Add your UI in the render section
3. Add functions to handle user actions
4. Update styles at the bottom

**To track new data:**
1. Open `src/store/useStore.js`
2. Add to the state object
3. Create actions to update it

## Step 4: Next Development Tasks

### Easy Tasks to Start:
1. **Change the pet appearance** 
   - Edit `src/components/Vista.js`
   - Look for the `renderPet()` function
   - Customize the pet design

2. **Add more hydration amounts**
   - Edit `src/screens/FluidFlowScreen.js`
   - Find the `hydrationAmounts` array
   - Add new options like `{ amount: 32, label: '+32 oz' }`

3. **Customize the home screen**
   - Add your own welcome message
   - Change module descriptions
   - Adjust the layout

### Medium Tasks:
1. **Complete the Vitality Screen**
   - Copy the structure from FluidFlowScreen.js
   - Implement energy logging
   - Add caffeine tracking

2. **Add animations**
   - Use the installed `react-native-reanimated`
   - Animate the pet movements
   - Add transition effects

### Advanced Tasks:
1. **Add camera functionality**
   - Install expo-camera
   - Implement photo capture
   - Add image analysis

2. **Set up push notifications**
   - Configure expo-notifications
   - Create notification schedules
   - Handle user permissions

## Step 5: Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** in VS Code
2. **Save files** - app auto-reloads
3. **Test features** on device/simulator
4. **Check console** for errors (in terminal)
5. **Commit changes** when features work

## Helpful Commands:

**If app crashes:**
```bash
# Press 'r' in terminal to reload
# Or shake device and select "Reload"
```

**To see console logs:**
```javascript
// Add this in your code:
console.log('Debug message:', someVariable);
```

**To clear cache:**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C) then:
npx expo start -c
```

## Tips for Success:

1. **Start small** - Change text and colors first
2. **Use hot reload** - See changes instantly
3. **Read errors carefully** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Test on real device** - Best way to experience the app
5. **Keep the docs handy**: 
   - [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
   - [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/)

## Your First Challenge:

Try these beginner-friendly tasks:
1. ‚úèÔ∏è Change the welcome message on the home screen
2. üé® Change the primary blue color to your favorite color
3. üìù Add a new tip in the Fluid Flow screen's Tips & Tricks section
4. üêæ Make the pet bigger in the Vista component

Remember: Every developer started exactly where you are. Take it one step at a time, and don't be afraid to experiment! The app will never "break" permanently - you can always undo changes.

Happy coding! üöÄ
